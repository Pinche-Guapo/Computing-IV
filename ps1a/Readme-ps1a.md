## Description
Explain what the project does.

It is to learn how to use xor and Test the code I made and getting used to Makefile file.

### Features
Describe the representation you used and why you did things that way.

For the tabs, I read it on the internet that xor works as addition if I and gate the numbers. Therefore, I used that method, but I also had problem earlier when I used ^ instead of + and I thought + is eaiser to read and think.

I could've used mutator function to change the binary string, but I thought it is going to demand more lines of codes.

For new bit that got added, I could not find a way to convert integer to string. I tried static-cast<char>(varible), or add the values for 1 and 0 as ascii, but nothing worked, so I just put used if statments.

### Issues
What doesn't work.  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

The programs work as it should.

### Tests
Describe what is being tested in your Boost unit tests.

## Changes

I had the points off because I did not have two new tests. Therefore, I added two test and it tests the program properly.
Also, my program runs well as it should and did the lint, too.
